# Activity-Recognition-Demo
# Temporal Logic Demo
A simple Python implementation of temporal rule-checking for activity recognition.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- Allen's Interval Algebra (basic "before"/"after" relationships)
- Time-constrained event sequencing

**How to Run:**
`python temporal_rules.py`
